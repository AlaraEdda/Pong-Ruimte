# Space Pong
I keep hitting the spacebar, but I'm still on üåç._

```
"In this war...
            A danger there is,
                          Of losing who we are‚Ä¶"
                          
```

## Assignment Explained
I have made this little exercise to warm myself up to Typescript. 
The goal of the game is to save as many Spaceships as you can by moving your Peddle up and down.
Everytime your paddle saves a Spaceship from dissapearing into the dark unknown (aka out of sight); you get a point.
But everytime a Spaceship dissapears you lose a live.

Can you save the Spaceships? Or will you die trying?

_Look up at the ‚ú® and not down at your keyboard.
