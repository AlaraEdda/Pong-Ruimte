"In this war...
            A danger there is,
                          Of losing who we areâ€¦"

## Assignment Explained
I have made this little exercise to warm myself up to Typescript. <br>
The goal of the game is to save as many Spaceships as you can by moving your paddle up(W) and down(S). <br>
Everytime your paddle saves a Spaceship; you get a point.<br>
But everytime a Spacehsip dissapears into the dark unknown (aka out of sight); you lose a live.<br>

_Can you save the Spaceships? Or will you die trying?<br>_
